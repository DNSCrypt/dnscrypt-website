# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is DNSCrypt?

<a href="https://dnscrypt.info/">DNSCrypt</a> is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and haven't been tampered with.

It is an open specification, with free and open source reference implementations, and it is not affiliated with any company or organization.

## What is DNS?

DNS is a globally distributed database that maps names to values. It is constantly used by all applications communicating over the Internet and private networks.

It typically translates names such as `www.google.com` into IP addresses such as `216.58.199.36`, so that devices can determine the path to follow in order to communicate with each other.

So what is the problem?

Originally, the DNS protocol didn't include any encryption nor authentication mechanisms; any device between a client and a DNS server could monitor and interfere with DNS traffic, without this being detected by the client.

Attackers on a local network can abuse this to conduct trivial attacks. More recently, malicious DNS servers have been massively used by malware.

The DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) were designed to partially mitigate this design flaw, by adding digital signatures to DNS responses.

## What is DNSSEC

DNSSEC is a DNS Extension that allows a client to validate the DNS response on supported domains and TLDs.

Resolvers check the digital signature of DNS responses to verify that the data match what the zone owner initially configured.

Unfortunately, [DNSSEC has received limited adoption](https://labs.ripe.net/Members/rene_bakker/bang-for-the-buck-the-adoption-of-dnssec-and-return-on-investment), remains incompatible with some devices and software pieces, and doesn't prevent the traffic from being monitored.

### DNS over TLS ([RFC7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858))

* <v-icon color=green>thumb_up</v-icon> Full encryption of the DNS protocol
* <v-icon color=green>thumb_up</v-icon> Has a low, but increasing number of servers in deployment
* <v-icon color=green>thumb_up</v-icon> Partially specified as a RFC
* <v-icon color=green>thumb_up</v-icon> [Many implementations completed at various stages](https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Implementation+Status)
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Provides more information than regular DNS to resolver operators in order to fingerprint clients, and this has (intentionally?) never been addressed in the specification
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Uses a dedicated port (853) likely to be blocked or monitored in situations where DNS encryption is useful
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Initial connection is slow due to the long handshake (until TLS 1.3 is deployed, which can take time due to [middleboxes](https://chefkochblog.wordpress.com/2017/12/20/tls-1-3-gets-blocked-by-cisco-avast-nsa/))
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Not well understood even by its proponents. It is a truck, as it is heavy and slow to load, but most if not all implementations perform a full round trip for every packet (even the excellent `miekg/dns` library as used by Tenta).
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Padding rules haven't been specified besides a draft that doesn't have any implementations, and a last-minute hack that requires altering DNS record sets before wrapping them
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Requires a full TLS stack, introducing a large attack surface
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Difficult to implement securely. Validating TLS certificates in non-browser software is [the most dangerous code in the world](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/ssl-client-bugs.html)
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Readily compatible with industry-standard TLS interception/monitoring devices. Having people [install additional root certificates](https://sk.tl/3n7mJ9K4) is easier than custom software.

* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Requires TCP
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Requires sessions tracking on the server
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> TLS is a generic transport mechanism. It doesn't support reordering and parallelism and doesn't include any ways to manage priorities. New mechanisms need to be invented and implemented to do so.
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Key management can be surprisingly hard especially if public key pinning is used by clients
* <v-icon color=red>thumb_down</v-icon> Allows insecure algorithms and parameters

## Practical considerations

All the solutions above offer the same practical security level. Compatibility with existing tools and infrastructure is what makes an actual difference.
